# Notifications Sender to handle several notifications channels

## Status

ACCEPTED

## Context and Problem Statement

The "Farmacy Food" system should allow sending notifications to subscribers after they have received the meal, to prompt them to send customer satisfaction feedback.

The system should support ability to send messages via various communications channels, e.g. SMS, push notifications, emails, recorded messages, etc.

### Requirements

* Support for push message, email, and/or SMS notifications to subscribed customers, some immediate and some deferred.

### Business Assumptions

Several communication channels to communicate with customers should be supported.

## Decision drivers

* Several communication channels should be supported by the notifications service.
* The core message processing, composition and sending is rather small and simple and is not supposed to change much.
* The specifics of sending messages via various channels is of no interest to the core.
* New media channels addition should be supported as simply as possible.
* TBD Michael

## Considered options

* Have the Notifications Sender engine be a microservice that communicates with other microservices dedicated to sending messages down specific channels.
* Make notifications Sender a microkernel service that supports communication capability plugins.

## Decision
